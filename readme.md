# Kira Demo

This is an Iced app designed to show off some of the features of [Kira](https://github.com/tesselode/kira), a Rust library for expressive game audio. You can see a video of it [here](https://youtu.be/4I0UqH6fNnc).

It currently contains these examples:
- Drum fill demo - demonstrates dynamically queueing music in time with `Sequence`s
- Underwater demo - demonstrates smoothly changing volumes and filter effects of various layers of music
